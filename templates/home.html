      <h5 class="card-title">Lakes</h5>
      <p class="card-text">Lakes are bodies of water that are surrounded by land. They are found on every continent and in every kind of environmentâ€”in mountains and deserts, on plains, and near seashores. Lakes vary greatly in size. Some measure only a few square meters and are small enough to fit in your backyard. Others are enormous, like the Caspian Sea, which is the largest lake in the world.</p>
