        <p>Lakes are bodies of water that are surrounded by land. They are found on every continent and in every kind of environmentâ€”in mountains and deserts, on plains, and near seashores. Lakes vary greatly in size. Some measure only a few square meters and are small enough to fit in your backyard. Others are enormous, like the Caspian Sea, which is the largest lake in the world.</p>
        <p>Lakes are formed in a variety of ways. Some are formed by glaciers, which carve out depressions in the land as they melt. Others are formed by volcanic activity, when lava flows into a valley and blocks a river. Still others are formed by tectonic activity, when the Earth's crust shifts and creates a basin.</p>
        <p>Lakes are important for many reasons. They provide a source of water for drinking, irrigation, and industry. They also support a variety of plant and animal life. Lakes are also important for recreation, providing opportunities for swimming, boating, fishing, and other activities.</p>
        <p>Lakes are a valuable resource that we need to protect. We can do this by reducing pollution, managing water levels, and preventing invasive species from entering lakes. By taking these steps, we can ensure that lakes will continue to provide benefits for generations to come.</p>
